# Core Pack

## Non-negotiables

- UX axis. Trust, clarity, efficiency, accessibility.
- Helga (68) is the design benchmark. If Helga fails, redesign.
- German-first. Layouts must survive 20-30% longer strings.

## Add On By Task

- Persona deep dive. Add `packs/research.md`.
- Partner and scope constraints. Add `packs/product.md`.
- Exact UI copy. Add `docs/artifacts/copy-guidelines.md`.
- Flows and IA artifacts. Add `docs/artifacts/visual-artifacts-rules.md` and `docs/artifacts/ia-map/IA.md`.
