# Partner Integrations Model

## Goal

Partners are visible but MedAlpha owns the end-to-end UX. Co-branded, not fragmented.

## Pattern

- MedAlpha UI shell and navigation.
- Feature content is unified.
- "Powered by [Partner]" attribution is explicit.

## Partners (As described)

- Curaay. In-person appointment booking availability and confirmations.
- Teleclinic. Telemedicine video consult experience.
- Cardlink and gematik. E-prescription retrieval via NFC and code flows.
- Apo Group. Online pharmacy ordering and delivery tracking.
- Google Maps. Pharmacy search and directions.
