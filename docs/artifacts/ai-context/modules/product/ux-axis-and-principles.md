# UX Axis and Principles

## UX Axis (Equal weight)

- Trust. Professional visuals, explicit confirmations, credible partner attribution.
- Clarity. No ambiguity. Step indicators. Explicit feedback at each step.
- Efficiency. Minimal steps, smart defaults, remembered preferences where safe.
- Accessibility. Works for seniors and low confidence users.

## Design Test

If a feature does not serve all four, redesign until it does.

## Principles (Behavioral)

- Explicit over implicit. Tell users what will happen before it happens.
- Recovery over prevention. Provide undo, edit, cancel. Do not rely on warnings.
- Confirmation over assumption. Confirm booking, ordering, consent, payments.
- Consistency over novelty. Surprise is bad in healthcare.
