# Personas Summary (Fast Load)

Use this when you need quick persona calibration without the full research file.

## Personas

- Sarah (34). Busy parent. Needs fast booking, family flows, refill reminders.
- Marc (42). Professional. Needs time efficiency, polished experience, on-demand consults.
- Helga (68). Senior. Needs big clarity, step guidance, high contrast, easy recovery.
- Elena (23). Young. Needs modern feel, discretion, quick answers.
- Thomas (51). Pragmatist. Needs cost transparency, simple confirmations, no salesy UX.

## Benchmark Rules

- Helga is the accessibility benchmark.
- Thomas is the trust benchmark for cost and commitment clarity.
