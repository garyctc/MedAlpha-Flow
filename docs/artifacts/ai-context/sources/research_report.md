## Key Insights & Recommendations

### 1. Diverse User Base Requires Flexible Design
The five personas span ages 23–68 and digital proficiency levels from moderate to very high. The app must accommodate both tech-savvy users (Elena, Marc) and less digitally confident users (Helga, Thomas) with clear navigation, large text options, and step-by-step guidance.

### 2. Telemedicine as a Core Differentiator
All five personas express interest in telemedicine, though for different reasons:
- **Sarah & Marc:** Convenience and time-saving for non-urgent concerns
- **Helga:** Accessibility and reduced travel burden
- **Elena:** Discreet access to professional advice
- **Thomas:** Cost-effective health information

Telemedicine should be a flagship feature, not an afterthought.

### 3. Prescription Ordering Must Be Seamless
The transition to OTC medication sales (December 2025) and the proposed prescription ordering feature must be intuitive. Helga's persona highlights the need for clear, step-by-step processes; Sarah's persona emphasizes automation (refill reminders); Marc's persona values speed.

### 4. Integration with Existing Services
The app should seamlessly integrate with dm's existing services:
- **Mein dm** loyalty program and Payback points
- **Click & Collect** pickup stations
- **In-store services** (friseur, kosmetikstudio, health checks via Aware partnership)
- **Online pharmacy** (OTC medications)

### 5. Accessibility & Inclusivity
With a significant user base aged 45+, the app must prioritize accessibility:
- Large, readable fonts
- High contrast ratios
- Simple, intuitive navigation
- Voice-guided options for complex tasks
- Offline functionality for critical features (e.g., prescription upload)

The key to success lies in balancing **convenience and accessibility**, **personalization and simplicity**, and **healthcare credibility with retail expertise**. The app should feel like a natural extension of dm's brand promise: *"Your daily companion for health, beauty, and well-being."*
